#### Files
- [bias_detect.ipynb](bias_detect.ipynb)
  - Where we trained our models, both the NER model and our baseline binary classifer
- [error_labeling.ipynb](error_labeling.ipynb)
  - Where we evaluated the performance of our NER model, scoring the classified token outputs
- [baseline_dbias.ipynb](baseline_dbias.ipynb)
  - We considered a 2021 classifer, [Dbias](https://github.com/dreji18/Fairness-in-AI), as a baseline. The classifier is published by the same authors of the paper and dataset that inspired our work. However, it is a bit stale and the performance did not meet our expectations.

  - Where we conducted an exploratory data analysis of the Nbias dataset.
